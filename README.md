Sample FastAPI server with JWT auth and Beanie ODM

## Intro

This starter app provides a basic account API on top of a [MongoDB]() store with the following features:

- Registration
- Email verification
- Password reset
- JWT auth login and refresh
- User model CRUD

It's built on top of these libraries to provide those features:

- [FastAPI]() - Python async micro framework built on [Starlette]() and [PyDantic]()
- [Beanie ODM]() - Async [MongoDB]() object-document mapper built on [PyDantic]()
- [fastapi-jwt-auth]() - JWT auth for [FastAPI]()
- [fastapi-mail]() - Mail server manager for [FastAPI]()

## Setup

This codebase was written for Python 3.9 and above. Don't forget about a venv as well. The `python` commands below assume you're pointing to your desired Python3 target.

First we'll need to install our requirements.

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Before we run the server, there is one config variable you'll need to generate the password salt. To do this, just run the script in this repo.

```bash
python gen_salt.py
```

There are other settings in `config.py` and the included `.env` file. Assuming you've changed the SALT value, everything should run as-is if there is a local [MongoDB]() instance running ([see below](#test) for a Docker solution). Any email links will be printed to the console by default.

## Run

This sample uses [uvicorn]() as our ASGI web server. This allows us to run our server code in a much more robust and configurable environment than the development server. For example, ASGI servers let you run multiple workers that recycle themselves after a set amount of time or number of requests.

```bash
uvicorn server.main:app --reload --port 8080
```

You're API should now be available at http://localhost:8080

## Test

The sample app also comes with a test suite to get you started.

Make sure to install the requirements found in the test folder before trying to run the tests.

```bash
python -m pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
```

The tests need access to a [MongoDB]() store that is emptied at the end of each test. The easiest way to do this is to run a Mongo container in the background.

```bash
docker run -d mongo
```

You can also connect to a remote server if you're running tests in a CI/CD pipeline. Just set the `TEST_MONGO_URI` in the environment. This value defaults to localhost and is only checked in the test suite. It should **never** use your `MONGO_URI`.

Then just run the test suite.

```bash
pytest
```
